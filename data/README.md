Clothing Co-Parsing (CCP) Dataset
=================================
![CCP example](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/bearpaw/clothing-co-parsing/master/example.jpg)

Clothing Co-Parsing (CCP) dataset is a new clothing database including elaborately annotated clothing items.

  - 2, 098 high-resolution street fashion photos with totally 59 tags
  - Wide range of styles, accessaries, garments, and pose
  - All images are with image-level annotations
  - 1000+ images are with pixel-level annotations

Feel free to contact `platero.yang (at) gmail.com` should you have any suggestions or questions.

Files
-----
Root directory contains following files and folders:
  - photos/                     - directory of original photos
  - annotations/                - directory of annotations
  	+ pixel-level/              - pixel-level annotations (1004 files)
  	+ image-level/              - image-level annotations (1094 files)
  - show_pixel_anno.m           - demo code for using pixel-level annotations
  - show_image_anno.m           - demo code for using image-level annotations 	
  - label_list.mat              - [1*59] cell array which maps label numbers to label names
  - samples.jpg                 - sample annotations
  - README.md                   - this file

Usage of the Database
---------------------
Please refer to `show_pixel_anno.m` and `show_image_anno.m` for detailed usage.

Notes on Image-Level Annotations
--------------------------------
Each annotation is saved in `annotations/image-level/` as a matlab `.mat` file, which is a variable
- tags: [n*1] matrix denotes the tags of the photo, where n is the number of the tags contained in the specific photo. 

Notes on Pixel-Level Annotations
--------------------------------
Each annotation is saved in `annotations/pixel-level` as a matlab `.mat` file, which is a variable

- groundtruth: [h*w] matrix denotes the annotated labels of pixels
